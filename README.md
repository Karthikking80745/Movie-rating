Project Description: Predicting Movie Success using Regression Models
This project aims to predict the success of movies based on various attributes using regression models. The process involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building regression models to forecast movie performance. By leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, we clean the data, visualize it, and build predictive models like Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The goal is to develop an accurate model that movie production companies can use to make informed decisions, ultimately leading to better financial outcomes and audience satisfaction.

Conclusion:
By the end of this project, we aim to have a robust model that can predict the success of movies based on their attributes. This model can be used by movie production companies to make informed decisions about their projects, ultimately leading to better financial outcomes and audience satisfaction.
